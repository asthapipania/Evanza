# Evanza
A banking Event Management System
EvAnza is a secure, efficient, and user-friendly Power Platform solution that transforms how financial institutions plan client events and manage nominations. Built with Microsoft Power Apps and backed by Azure SQL, EvAnza eliminates manual processes and empowers Relationship Managers (RMs) to create events, define client selection criteria, and nominate high-value clients with ease.

From exclusive investment summits to wealth management webinars, EvAnza ensures that every event targets the right clients—based on meaningful financial data like AUM (Assets Under Management) and Revenue—pulled live from secure databases.

💡 Why EvAnza?
✅ No More Spreadsheets: Automate filtering of clients using custom selection criteria

⚡ Real-Time Performance: Instantly fetch and display top N clients based on event-specific filters

🔐 Enterprise-Grade Security: Data stored and handled via Azure SQL with strict access control

🧩 Modular & Scalable: Easily adaptable for future additions like attendance tracking or feedback forms

💼 Tailored for Bankers: Purpose-built interface for relationship managers and client teams

🧩 Core Features
Event creation with details like name, type, time, venue, capacity, and budget

Custom selection criteria entry for client nominations (e.g., AUM and Revenue ranges)

Dynamic filtering of top N clients from Existing or Prospect customer tables

Interactive client panels with nomination dropdowns (Nominated / Not Nominated)

Secure storage of nomination data in a centralized Azure SQL database

🌐 Use Case Example
A Relationship Manager is preparing for a premium client event. With EvAnza, they create the event, set the desired client criteria (e.g., AUM > ₹5Cr, Revenue > ₹30L), and instantly retrieve the top 25 matching clients from the database. The RM selects nominees directly from the interface—ensuring targeted, data-driven engagement in minutes.

Note: EvAnza is currently in the development phase. I would love the opportunity to showcase the complete solution during judging sessions and fireside chats. Due to my university exams last month, the majority of the development was done within just 8 days. I’m eager to present the full, refined version of EvAnza soon.
